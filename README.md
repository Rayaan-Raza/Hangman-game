# Hangman-game
A simple version of the word game Hangman, This game
will be played in the terminal window. In this game, the computer picks a random secret word
from an available list. The player then guesses a letter that they think may appear in the word.
The computer checks whether the letter appears in the word and either reveals all instances of
it (if it exists) or takes away one of the player's lives. The computer then displays the progress
that the player has made towards guessing the word. The game continues until either all of the
letters have been guessed (and the player wins) or all of the player's lives are used up (and the
player loses). In either case, the computer should announce this event and the game should end.
